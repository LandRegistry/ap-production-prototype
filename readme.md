# new Application Processing UI design (2023)

Whilst migrating as-is functionality from the current live product to a new front end tech stack, there are some design implications

This repo is to help us ideate and test those changes, as well as document details about the changes and progress with the migration.

We may also want to use this repo for new AP work, post migration.


## running this app

this repo is a copy of GOV.UK Prototype Kit version 13

[version 13 is a significant change](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/whats-new) from previous versions

for example

- node 18 is needed
- its 'npm run dev' NOT 'npm start' to run the proto locally
- template / layout locations in the app have changed


## also added to the empty proto kit app:

- jquery has been installed
- [HMLR design system components](http://hmlr-design-system.herokuapp.com/get-started/prototyping/) (currently header and footer)
