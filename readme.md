# Application Processing 'Production' prototype

This repo contains a copy of the new UI repo, now hosted seperately and edited for use in demonstrations to users.

This is to help us keep final work and works in progress distinct. The content here is intended for use by product and devs as well as users and so should not contain any sensitive information.

We will aim to update this repo with all features which have been finalised and handed over to delivery teams.


## running this app

this repo is a copy of GOV.UK Prototype Kit version 13

[version 13 is a significant change](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/whats-new) from previous versions

for example

- node 18 is needed
- its 'npm run dev' NOT 'npm start' to run the proto locally
- template / layout locations in the app have changed


## also added to the empty proto kit app:

- jquery has been installed
- [HMLR design system components](http://hmlr-design-system.herokuapp.com/get-started/prototyping/) (currently header and footer)
