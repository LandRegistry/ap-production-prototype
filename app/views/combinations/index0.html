    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Combinations - Phase 3, DTC + RX1</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">Applications which contain any of the following transactions, combined into a full application flow:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Subsequent discharge</li>
      <li>Transfer for value</li>
      <li>Charge</li>
      <li>Adding a restriction (RX1)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A combination in Application Processing will start with a summary page, which lists the inlcuded transactions and identifies where transactions may need to be completed in CORA. The first page of tasks in combinations is 'initial tasks' which cover the application level tasks. Transactions tasks are then presented in the order shown in the summary page.</p>
    <p>Features of combinations include:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>Ability to skip a transaction - If a user can't proceed with a certain transaction they can skip it, to then continue processing in AP. The 'cancel processing this transaction' link replaces the 'return to workflow' link and takes the user to an interim summary page where they can choose to either continue processing or drop the whole case out to Workflow.</li>
    	<li>Statuses - If a transaction has been skipped it will appear as 'Not drafted' in subsequent summary pages. The status of the transactions is confirmed in the final summary screen with information about what happens next and a dynamic button for if the case will submit to markoff or be sent to Workflow for the resolution of PAS notes.</li>
    	<li>Partial saving - Transactions are saved once a user has moved past them. The 'save and continue' button at the end of each transaction marks each drafting save point.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The system will:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>add a PAS note, allowing the application to be stored until the consent is received</li>
    	<li>put the application in a new 'pot' (category of work) to be picked up for evidence to be checked</li>
    	<li>run all the business rules again, to see if anything else has changed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Round 2 prototypes for user research</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">For the second round we are testing iterations of some elements of the design. These include new versions of the restrictions question which should clarify which restrictions it is referring to and updating the deferral confirmation screen to no longer mention workflow as that had caused confusion. We also want to test new scenarios to establish when certain screens are misaligned with caseworkers expectations despite accurately representing the systems actions.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Round 1 prototypes for user research</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">From these scenarios we hoped to learn about the relationship between both deferral questions (charge evidence and restrictions), how users understood deferrals in charges, and how they navigate and review restrictions on the register.</p>

    <p><a href="/charge-defer/r1-index">link for user research</a></p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1a/00-worklist">A - Both UI tasks</a><br>
        Scenario A: The register contains a charge with a restriction and another type of restriction. The other type of restriction does not require consent. The charge evidence is missing. The application should defer with the charge evidence, however our assumption is that it won't due to both tasks being present and caseworkers answering with workarounds.
      </li>
    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1b/00-worklist">B - Two restrictions</a><br>
        Scenario B: One restriction requires consent, one does not. Consent has not been provided for the restriction that requires it and the case should therefore defer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1c/07-wrap-up">C - Multiple restrictions</a><br>
        Scenario C: Multiple restrictions, some needing consent and others not. Consent has been provided for all that require it and therefore the case should markoff.
      </li>
    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1d/07-wrap-up">D - Referral</a><br>
        Scenario D: One restriction that is above EO settlement (Form B). This will require the users to refer the case to a caseworker of a higher grade. The referral option then adds a PAS note and returns to Workflow.
      </li>
