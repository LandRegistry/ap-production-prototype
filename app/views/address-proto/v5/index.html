       </li>
       <li>
       Once all names have been added to the page, users presses 'next'. Doing so brings them to a page showing the empty addresses table. The page is still withing the subflow.
       </li>
       <li>
        Users need to enter the details of the addresses before they can press 'create custom lender entry'. They do so by pressing on 'add address'.
        <li>
         They'll then select the type of address they want to add and press next. In the prototype the first address they have to select is UK postal address.
        </li>
       <li>
     User completes the required details about the address and press 'save address'.
       </li>

      </li>
