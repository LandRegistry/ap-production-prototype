      <p class="govuk-body">Design for creating a custom lender entry as part of the Charge flow. User is asked to enter the name of the lender(s) and their addresses. The design shows the scenario in which <b>only UK postal addresses </b> are accepted.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Which design for when the address type is not accepted in AP is shown?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body"> Design in which answering YES to the UI task 'Other than UK postal addresses is there anything else you want to add? on the addresses table page causes the application to be rejected.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are the lenders names in the prototype?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Arthur Boyle and Marianne Malkovic </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are the steps that the user is asked to follow in the prototype?</h2>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
    	<li>
       Users starts from the MD ref / register entries page.
      </li>
      <li>
       In order to start the sub-flow for creating a custom lender entry, they have to press the 'Create custom lender entry' button within the register entries section.
       </li>
       <li>
       By doing so, users enter a sub-flow.
       </li>
       <li>
The first step of the sub-flow asks them to enter the names of all the lenders. In this prototypes there are two names to be added.
       </li>
       <li>
       Once all names have been added to the page, users presses 'next'. Doing so brings them to a page showing the empty addresses table. The page is still withing the subflow.
       </li>
       <li>
        Users need to enter the details of the addresses before they can press 'create custom lender entry'. They do so by pressing on 'add address'.
        <li>
         They are then shown the address lookup design (as the only type of address accepted in this phase are UK postal addresses).
        </li>
       <li>
     User completes the required details about the address and press 'save address'.
       </li>
       <li>
        The address gets so added to the table. Now users can press 'create custom lender entry', having also answered 'Other than UK postal addresses is there anything else you want to add?
'
          </li>
          <li>
           The newly created custom lender entry gets so added to the 'register entries' section for them to double check and eventually amend/remove.
              </li>
              <li>
               End of the flow. They can press 'next' or 'return to workflow' to go back to the index.
                   </li>
    </ol>
