    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Check your answers</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">This feature enables a caseworker to check and change the answers they have provided in Application Processing. The linked demo represents the MVP build, which will enable users to view all provided answers and change them by returning to the transaction and its associated tasks.</p>
    <p>This demo includes:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>an application involving a combination of transactions (Discharge, Transfer for value, Charge, RX1) submitted by two private individuals.</li>
    	<li>a scenario which begins at the end of processing, allowing the user to view the 'check your answers' tab as part of the final summary page.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The demo's path assumes that the application has been processed. The user notes that the <b>proprietors names must be 'Scotts' instead of 'Scott' </b>as was previously entered. You can change this response by following the change link next to the relevant task and returning to the transaction.
    <br><br><i>Note: Changing the names of the transferees is the only interaction currently programmed into this demo. Other links will not function here but will be accessible in the live release.</i></p>
<!--
    <p class="govuk-body">The system will:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>add a PAS note, allowing the application to be stored until the consent is received</li>
    	<li>put the application in a new 'pot' (category of work) to be picked up for evidence to be checked</li>
    	<li>run all the business rules again, to see if anything else has changed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Round 2 prototypes for user research</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">For the second round we are testing iterations of some elements of the design. These include new versions of the restrictions question which should clarify which restrictions it is referring to and updating the deferral confirmation screen to no longer mention workflow as that had caused confusion. We also want to test new scenarios to establish when certain screens are misaligned with caseworkers expectations despite accurately representing the systems actions.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Round 1 prototypes for user research</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">From these scenarios we hoped to learn about the relationship between both deferral questions (charge evidence and restrictions), how users understood deferrals in charges, and how they navigate and review restrictions on the register.</p>

    <p><a href="/charge-defer/r1-index">link for user research</a></p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1a/00-worklist">A - Both UI tasks</a><br>
        Scenario A: The register contains a charge with a restriction and another type of restriction. The other type of restriction does not require consent. The charge evidence is missing. The application should defer with the charge evidence, however our assumption is that it won't due to both tasks being present and caseworkers answering with workarounds.
      </li>
    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1b/00-worklist">B - Two restrictions</a><br>
        Scenario B: One restriction requires consent, one does not. Consent has not been provided for the restriction that requires it and the case should therefore defer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1c/07-wrap-up">C - Multiple restrictions</a><br>
        Scenario C: Multiple restrictions, some needing consent and others not. Consent has been provided for all that require it and therefore the case should markoff.
      </li>
    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1d/07-wrap-up">D - Referral</a><br>
        Scenario D: One restriction that is above EO settlement (Form B). This will require the users to refer the case to a caseworker of a higher grade. The referral option then adds a PAS note and returns to Workflow.
      </li>
