    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">background information</h3>
    <p>when the caseworker is asked for a or, b</p>

    <p>current examples are:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>charge amount (input it), or not stated (say not stated)</li>
      <li>charge date (input it), or no date (say no date)</li>
      <li>md reference (input it), or no md-ref needed (say no md-ref)</li>
      <li>document retention - what is the date of this document (input it), or not given/can't read it</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Gov design system has a <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes/">mutually exclusive pattern for checkboxes</a></p>
    <p>We want to have an input field(s) or, a check box</p>

    <p>In <a href="https://hmlr-application-processing.herokuapp.com/non-md-cre/v1/a/02-your-tasks">the current way we do charge date and amount</a>, we have Javascript behaviour that deactivates the date input.  We want to avoid de-activating<super>*</super>, and improve the pattern visually making it more GOV like.</p>

    <p>We dont want to ask a yes/ no question first - as almost all the time the caseworker will have the charge amount or date so we want them to just enter that and say, not present only occasionally.  Optimise around - it is always present</p>

    <p>ONS have a mutually exclusive component<super>*</super> - similar in behaviour to the Gov design system checkbox, for more than just checkbox list - that looks just like the circumstances we want: <a href="https://service-manual.ons.gov.uk/design-system/components/mutually-exclusive#date">Date</a> | <a href="https://service-manual.ons.gov.uk/design-system/components/mutually-exclusive#number">Number</a></p>
    <p><super>*</super>note: porting over the ONS js code and html, but not the css illustrates the assistive technogy features built in to the ONS pattern (to make it pass WCAG accessibilty requiremements - presume these do make it pass).  If we continue with de-activating, or other behaviour, we also need to make it accessible.  Don't know what assistive technology feature code is in production currently.

    <p>We need a non Javascript version.  and can progressively enhance it for Javascript users (nearly all).  We like the ONS behaviour, but lets make it GOV styled - e.g. no borders round the checkbox, and GOV error styling.</p>

    <p>We need to document how the non js works, and write error messages for the non js version.  ONS and Gov checkboxes have the non js error messages behaviour we want to copy.</p>
