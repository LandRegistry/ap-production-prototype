    <p class="govuk-body">When an application does not include evidence of discharge, and we need to request it because there are restricitions in the register, a caseworker:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>will know evidence is required</li>
      <li>will write a requisition letter (C90), if this is the only reason to requisition</li>
      <li>use legacy system PC Corres to write the letter</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">the system will:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>add a PAS note, allowing the application to be stored until the evidence is received</li>
    	<li>put the application in a new 'pot' (category of work) to be picked up for evidence to be checked</li>
    	<li>run all the business rules again, to see if anything else has changed</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">A different caseworker (almost certainly):</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>will pick up the application</li>
      <li>check the evidence (electronic discharge via the daylist)</li>
      <li>do any additional tasks required - if circumstances have changed (Business rules will establish this)</li>
      <li>complete the application - markoff, or send it to legacy processing</li>
    </ul>
