    <p>This protoype is intended for demonstration purposes only. It contains final designs for Application Processing that have or will be handed over to teams to build. </p>
    <p>These designs should replicate the UI in the live service, however may not fully reproduce behaviours due to the limitations of this prototype kit. The prototype should be updated regularly but may contain inconsistencies as more features are added and flows are updated. If you find an error or inconsistency please inform a member of the AP design team.</p>

    <p>This prototype is also set up as the new UI rewrite of AP and will gradually replace the <a href="https://hmlr-application-processing.herokuapp.com/">current prototype</a></p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">About this prototype</h2>

    <p>This kit is based on the Gov prototype kit.</p>
    <p>This prototype was last updated on 25/01/2024.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">AP wide functionality</h2>

    <p>Final designs of components and pages used across the AP flows. The UI around each might be misaligned with the rest of the service as the aim is simply to demonstrate singular components.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Work to do in this prototype</h2>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>add all new designs from production - things Phoenix have made - make the prototype styled the same, behave the same, and contains the components</li>
      <li>document the new components, and behaviour - so designers can make new flows easily, and we have design documentation e.g. when to use, and how well tested things are</li>
      <li>rebuild components that rely on client side JS, to work with no JS - so they mimic production behaviour.  and we get accustomed to prototyping no JS flows then progressively enhancing</li>
      <li>create migration notes/kit - to migrate flows over from the current prototype (so we retire that).  Migrate over any current flows? like LAI and combinations?</li>
      <li>PAS notes - see if we want to do something with them</li>
      <li>Analytics experiment (Jason)</li>
      <li>Workflow - should we build that here, or just a few pages needed for AP flows?  Perhaps we could make a journey that joins 2 prototypes together</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Scope of UI re-write</h2>

    <p>Technical UI re-write, into python/Flask, from react.</p>
    <p>Limit the number of UI changes. This is about keeping as much as-is from the current UI, and the tech re-write
      brings the UI up to current HMLR code and design standards. It removes existing constraints that have limited user
      features, so new work post re-write can be done without working round the constraints.</p>
    <p>UI changes are limited to those required by: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>migrating to python/flask - some ui features may be difficult to migrate as-is from react. Where this is the
        case we'll redesign the ui feature to make it easy to implement</li>
      <li>following common HMLR code and design standards - progressive enhancement, using gov components out of the box
      </li>
      <li>fixing accessibility failures in the current UI</li>
      <li>minimising rework. Make some design changes - that are considered to be foundational - for example responsive
        page layout - to avoid complex rework once all the UI features have been migrated</li>
    </ul>
