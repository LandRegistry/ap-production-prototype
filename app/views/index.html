    <p>Design experiments and documentation for UI technology re-write to python/flask</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Making pages in this kit</h2>

    <p>this kit is based on the Gov prototype kit.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting started</h3>
    <p>Copy the <a href="example-flow/">Example (starter) flow</a>.</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>Copy that into a new folder in views, and call the folder what you want</li>
    	<li>add a route to the main routes file (app/routes.js) - a route that looks at the folder you just created.  see lines 12 to 19 to see what to copy.  replace /example-flow with youer folder name</li>
    	<li>inside your views foler make the versions of your prototype, make folders names v1, v2 etc.</li>
    	<li>everything required to make a flow is contained in the example flow...</li>
    	<li>Use the notes within the code of the example flow to make your own flow</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How the template (example) flow has been made</h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3 page layouts</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>documentation page - use <code>&#123;&#37; extends "layouts/ap-documentation.html" &#37;&#125;</code> at the top of your page</li>
			<li>wide page, the two column, register and task page - use <code>&#123;&#37; extends "layouts/ap-flow-wide.html" &#37;&#125;</code> at the top of your page</li>
		  <li>regular width page, like confirmation - use <code>&#123;&#37; extends "layouts/ap-flow-regular.html" &#37;&#125;</code> at the top of your page</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">css</h3>
    <p>There are 4 css files, refactoring is needed as there is duplication.  Using the 3 layouts will load the correct css.  If you need to add something, consider adding it to the 2 css files - regular and wide - for the two page width layouts we have</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Javascript</h3>
    <p>any JS needed by more than one page, you can get the template to load the scripts.  Add a line to the <code>/include/scripts.html</code> file.</p>

      


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">UI documentation</h2>

    <p>Final designs</p>
    <p>Tested with users (where noted)</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><a href="complete/system-messages/">system messages</a></li>
      <li><a href="complete/confirmation-pages/">confirmation pages</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Experiments</h2>

    <p>Exploring ideas. Use for ideation and testing with users.</p>

    <p>page layouts</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><a href="experiments/page-templates/confirmation-page-blank">confirmation page - blank</a></li>
      <li><a href="experiments/">Lorenzo and Puneets noodling</a></li>
      <li><a href="experiments/andy/">Andy noodling</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Scope of UI re-write</h2>

    <p>Technical UI re-write, into python/Flask, from react.</p>
    <p>Limit the number of UI changes. This is about keeping as much as-is from the current UI, and the tech re-write
      brings the UI up to current HMLR code and design standards. It removes existing constraints that have limited user
      features, so new work post re-write can be done without working round the constraints.</p>
    <p>UI changes are limited to those required by: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>migrating to python/flask - some ui features may be difficult to migrate as-is from react. Where this is the
        case we'll redesign the ui feature to make it easy to implement</li>
      <li>following common HMLR code and design standards - progressive enhancement, using gov components out of the box
      </li>
      <li>fixing accessibilty failures in the current UI</li>
      <li>minimising rework. Make some design changes - thats are considered to be foundational - for example responsive
        page layout - to avoid complex rework once all the UI features have been migrated</li>
    </ul>
