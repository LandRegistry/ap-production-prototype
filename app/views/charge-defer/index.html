    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Charge - deferral for consent to restriction</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">When an application contains a restriction which requires the consent of a specified party. If the consent is missing a requisition needs to be sent and the application deferred (put into a specific pot whilst we wait for a response to the requistion).</p>
    <p>A caseworker:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>will know if consent is required</li>
      <li>will write a requisition letter (C90), if this is the only reason to requisition</li>
      <li>use legacy system PC Corres to write the letter</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The system will:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>add a PAS note, allowing the application to be stored until the consent is received</li>
    	<li>put the application in a new 'pot' (category of work) to be picked up for evidence to be checked</li>
    	<li>run all the business rules again, to see if anything else has changed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Round 2 prototypes for user research</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">For the second round we are testing iterations of some elements of the design. These include new versions of the restrictions question which should clarify which restrictions it is referring to and updating the deferral confirmation screen to no longer mention workflow as that had caused confusion. We also want to test new scenarios to establish when certain screens are misaligned with caseworkers expectations despite accurately representing the systems actions.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Round 1 prototypes for user research</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">From these scenarios we hoped to learn about the relationship between both deferral questions (charge evidence and restrictions), how users understood deferrals in charges, and how they navigate and review restrictions on the register.</p>

    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1a/00-worklist">A - Both UI tasks</a><br>
        Scenario A: The register contains a charge with a restriction and another type of restriction. The other type of restriction does not require consent. The charge evidence is missing. The application should defer with the charge evidence, however our assumption is that it won't due to both tasks being present and caseworkers answering with workarounds.
      </li>
    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1b/00-worklist">B - Two restrictions</a><br>
        Scenario B: One restriction requires consent, one does not. Consent has not been provided for the restriction that requires it and the case should therefore defer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1c/07-wrap-up">C - Multiple restrictions</a><br>
        Scenario C: Multiple restrictions, some needing consent and others not. Consent has been provided for all that require it and therefore the case should markoff.
      </li>
    	<li>
        <a class="govuk-link" href="charge-defer/v1d/07-wrap-up">D - Referral</a><br>
        Scenario D: One restriction that is above EO settlement (Form B). This will require the users to refer the case to a caseworker of a higher grade. The referral option then adds a PAS note and returns to Workflow.
      </li>
